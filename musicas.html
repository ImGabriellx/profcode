            <h3>Robin Schulz & Richard judge - Show me love</h3>
            <p>There's a notebook on the table<br>
                You can take it to the store<br>
                So you won't forget the groceries anymore<br>
                There's a rifle in the cabinet that I used to fight a war<br>
                But to this day, I don't know what I was fighting for<br>
                I'm fighting for<br>
                <br>
                Will you show me love as we get older<br>
                And I'm falling at your feet<br>
                After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me<br>
                Show me love as we grow colder<br>
                Let our love provide the heat<br>
                That our older bones are missing<br>
                But our hearts will never need<br>
                <br>
                There's a blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm<br>
                When I find you fast asleep at half past four<br>
                There's a record we keep turning that reminds us of our youth<br>
                But there's still nothing as beautiful as you<br>
                <br>
                Will you show me love as we get older<br>
                And I'm falling at your feet<br>
                After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me<br>
                Show me love as we grow colder<br>
                Let our love provide the heat<br>
                That our older bones are missing<br>
                But our hearts will never need<br>
                <br>
                As we grow colder<br>
                Love provide the heat<br>
                Older bones are missing<br>
                Hearts will never meet<br>
                Because your hand, belongs in my hand<br>
                Belongs in your hand, belongs with, with me<br>
                (Blanket on the sofa that I used to keep you warm<br>
                There's a record we keep turning that I used to turn you on)<br>
                <br>
                Show me love as we get older<br>
                And I'm falling at your feet<br>
                After 30 years of service and the wounds of it are me<br>
                Show me love as we grow colder<br>
                Let our love provide the heat<br>
                That our older bones are missing<br>
                But our hearts will never need</p><br>
